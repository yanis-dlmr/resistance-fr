"""Define resistance-fr version information."""

# We follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)

# When building releases, we can update this value on the release branch to
# reflect the current release candidate ('rc0', 'rc1') or, finally, the official
# stable release (indicated by `_VERSION_SUFFIX = ''`). Outside the context of a
# release branch, the current version is by default assumed to be a
# 'development' version, labeled 'dev'.

# Example, '0.4.0-dev'
__version__ = '0.1.2'
