You do not explicitly need a conda environment for the bot to run. But it is always recommended nontheless, especially because the next LTS of Ubuntu won't let users pip-install anything without a virtual environment. At the time of writing, this bot requires `python >= 3.11` to run.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yanis-dlmr/resistance-fr.git
cd resistance-fr
```

You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands :

```bash
# Creates environment and install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml -y
conda activate dsc
```

Finally, run the bot in the background with `bash run.bash` or type the following :

```bash
# Runs the bot (lets you Ctrl+C to stop it)
python resistance-fr.py
```

## üíÅ Get Help

Inside the Discord app, you can type

```txt
/<GroupName> help
```

to get help about a specific group of commands. For example, you can type `/utils help` to get help about the `utils` group of commands.

You can try to ping the bot in your guild to start üëã :

```txt
/utils ping
```

> The standard procedure is :
>

Happy coding ! üôÇ
